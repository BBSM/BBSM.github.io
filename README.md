IBM_project

Training with Bootstrap V4, SASS, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and JQuery.

The aim of this project is to present briefly the IBM's artificial intelligence "Watson". I based on several official websites of IBM to gather information and do a little summary.

the images I used are not all free / open source for use. I used them only for this training which has no commercial goal.

You can see the website thanks to this link : https://bbsm.github.io/
